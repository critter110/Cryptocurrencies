# Cryptocurrencies
For this challenge, we were tasked with using unsupervised machine learning to group together different crypto-currencies in order to get a better idea which ones might be worth investing in. We were given a large csv file with each row describing a different crypto-currency. We started by loading the data into a pandas dataframe and cleaning it up by removing some un needed columns and removing rows of unwanted currencies. We then changed the columns with text data into numerical data and scaled it to prepare for the machine learning process. We then performed PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset down to 3 dimensions. We then inspected the data by creating an elbow curve in order to choose how many clusters our data looks like it should have. We then performed KMeans analysis and specified 7 clusters. We then created a new clean data frame with all of the importand info and the newly defined class info describing which cluster each currency belongs to. Finally we created two graphs, one 3D graph to visualize the clusters, and one 2D scatter plot to analyze supply and demand for the different currencies.
